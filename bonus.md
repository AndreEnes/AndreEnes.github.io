### Ray Tracer

To explore C/C++ beyond my usual scope, I worked through [Ray Tracing In One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html). This book guides you from scratch to producing an image like this:

The instructions are clear and rewarding, making it easy to achieve basic renders. However, the project is minimalisticâ€”small mistakes can lead to unexpected results, such as:

Rendering the final image took about an hour ðŸ™ƒ.
