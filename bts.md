## ⚠️ WARNING ⚠️

This section is not strictly "professional". Let a bit loose. Check out the [Projects](projects.md) tab for that.

## Behind the Scenes

Who doesn't appreciate a more honest view on one's work? Look at the uncropped and very compressed profile pic:

Here lies a collection of random thoughts and ideas.

## Hobbies

Photography is cool. Flash photography is also cool. Here are some pictures:

## Shower Thoughts

- An Applewatch does the same thing as my beautiful sensor system, expect it predicts faults in humans.
- Can people that speak tonal languages be sarcastic? I refuse to google this.
- Guarda-redes de andebol tem o equipamento mais ressolha à face da terra.
<!-- - STMicroelectronics' website feels like this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy63PEgmm8w). -->
- Prince died of a fentanyl overdose in 2016, pioneer through and through.
- Long-haired men must be confident in their genetics. Or must be ready to let the hair go when the time comes.
- People turn almost anything into nostalgia, look at Pen&Pixel album covers.
- I speak a new language: Tech Creole. I classify it as a mixture between Portuguese, English and technical jargon.
<!-- - [Why we use the cheddar as a measure of our opulence?](https://genius.com/Nickelus-f-and-shawn-kemp-bathory-motives-lyrics) -->

## Great Teachings of Life

- Se rima, é verdade. (If it rhymes, it's true)
- Don't start with trying to make things generic. By the time you finish it, the deadline has passed. It's better to make something with a specific goal in mind and later adapting it. If making things generic were reliable, consulting companies would cease to exist. Death and Taxes and Deloitte.
- Working with unmotivated people is like trying to save someone who is drowning. They will pull you down. Saving one alone is nearly impossible without the right tools or help.
- Never miss a change to go to the bathroom.
- Don't look at MIT applications on Youtube, you will feel dumb.
- Admiration and jealousy are not too far apart, look at the previous line. Here's some other sources of jealation:
  - [Ashrita Furman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashrita_Furman)
  - [HAN Lab](https://hanlab.mit.edu/)
  - [EdgeImpulse](https://edgeimpulse.com/)
  - [People who are never jealous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie).

## Portuguese Sayings in English

- It's many years flipping chickens.
- And what does the ass have to do with the pants?

## Project Ideas that are available for stealing

- Analog synthesizer using an aux cable as input
  - Cool to apply effects to live audio
  - Toaster cenas
- TinyML: detect seagulls with cheap camera...
- Draw a line, convert it into a sound envelope and make music or an effect or smth
- Active noise cancelling for specific measurements for Anomaly Detection / Predictive Maintenance

## Cool things I'd like to know more about

- The Wavelet Transform.
- How are Kalman Filters used in an economic scenario? Wikipedia always says this.
- How to draw a series of not intersecting shapes inside a fixed area.
