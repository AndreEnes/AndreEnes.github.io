I love hackathons and random competitions. Being really focused is awesome. It's a shame that most of them are intended for university students.
For some of the ones I participated in, I don't have many remaining evidences, but I can recall them, at least.

## Media Dive - Aveiro Tech City

Hosted by Altice Labs, this challenge asked participants to create new ways for viewers to interact with enriched TV content.

Altice, owner of MEO, a major telecommunications and TV provider in Portugal, gave access to three channels with their schedules and metadata. The goal was to design a project that could improve client viewership.

Teams knew the challenge a week in advance and had 12 hours on the competition day to build a prototype and presentation.

My team’s project, ZapZop — a mix of zapping and TikTok — showed short clips of shows matched to a user’s personality. Viewers could click a clip to watch the full program.

We didn’t win. The winning project was basically the same idea, just better.
