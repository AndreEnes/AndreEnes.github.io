## AndrÃ© Enes

LinkedIn can be overwhelming. Perhaps a quieter space will allow me to share my work with less pressure. Check out the _Curriculum Vitae_ page for a concise overview of my projects, and explore the other pages for more detailed context.

I am a recent graduate in Electrical and Computer Engineering with hands-on experience in embedded systems, real-time applications, and applied machine learning. I am eager to apply and expand my technical expertise by contributing to innovative solutions in industry.

I am currently working as a Software Engineer at [Critical Techworks](https://www.criticaltechworks.com/), and I hold a [Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/CUR_GERAL.CUR_VIEW?pv_ano_lectivo=2025&pv_origem=CUR&pv_tipo_cur_sigla=M&pv_curso_id=22806) from the University of Porto.

On this website, you can explore some of the projects and hackathons I have worked on.

<!-- One of this blog's/portfolio's/webpage's inspirations was an old blog I found, from the 90's. It was hosted in my university's domain and it belonged to a late professor. I no longer have access to it, but I remember it had all sorts of things. Course material and his academic work were in it, of course, but it also had pictures that we took. It had his granddaughter at her birthday. It had pictures of his students at the Cortejo (an academic parade in downtown Porto), I even found one of my professors at the time. He probably coded it himself. I'm lucky, I have access to so many easy to use tools. -->

<!-- So, I hope this page finds you well and feel free to look around. -->
