## AndrÃ© Enes

LinkedIn can be overwhelming. Perhaps a quieter space will allow me to share my work with less pressure. Check out the _Curriculum Vitae_ page for a concise overview of my projects, and explore the other pages for more detailed context.

I am a recent graduate in Electrical and Computer Engineering with hands-on experience in embedded systems, real-time applications, and applied machine learning. I am eager to apply and expand my technical expertise by contributing to innovative solutions in industry.

I am currently working as a Software Engineer at [Critical Techworks](https://www.criticaltechworks.com/), and I hold a [Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/CUR_GERAL.CUR_VIEW?pv_ano_lectivo=2025&pv_origem=CUR&pv_tipo_cur_sigla=M&pv_curso_id=22806) from the University of Porto.

This website showcases some of the projects I have worked on as well as the hackathons I have taken part in.
