## André Enes

LinkedIn is a battleground. Maybe a quieter page will make me share my work with less anxiety.

<!-- One of this blog's/portfolio's/webpage's inspirations was an old blog I found, from the 90's. It was hosted in my university's domain and it belonged to a late professor. I no longer have access to it, but I remember it had all sorts of things. Course material and his academic work were in it, of course, but it also had pictures that we took. It had his granddaughter at her birthday. It had pictures of his students at the Cortejo (an academic parade in downtown Porto), I even found one of my professors at the time. He probably coded it himself. I'm lucky, I have access to so many easy to use tools. -->

<!-- So, I hope this page finds you well and feel free to look around. -->
