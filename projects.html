<h2>Projects</h2>

<h3>Sensor System for Predictive Maintenance</h3>
<p>
  Sensor module design, embedded development, and ML for predictive maintenance.<br />

</p>

<h4>Highlights</h4>
<h4>Lowlights</h4>
<h4>Lessons Learned</h4>

<h3>ML Regression Toolkit (Internship)</h3>
<p>Python toolkit using XGBoost, SHAP, and Streamlit for regression optimization.</p>

<h4>Highlights</h4>
<h4>Lowlights</h4>
<h4>Lessons Learned</h4>

<h3>Extended Kalman Filter for a Quadcopter</h3>
<p>
  Developed a 3D position estimation system for an aerial robot using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The setup involved static beacons placed at known locations, measuring distances to the robot.
</p>
<p>
  Built with Webots, ROS, Python, and C++, the system integrates sensor data and simulates beacon-based localization. The project covered EKF development, implementation, and analysis of results.
</p>

<h4>Highlights</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Had to understand how to apply theory to practice.</li>
  <li>Gained a lot of experience with handling messy tools like WeBots. The support was poor and ChatGPT was still at a point where you were lucky if it was available due to high demand, so I spent many hours banging my head against the wall.</li>
  <li>Got to see lots of cool drones in one of the laboratories of the Universidad de Sevilla, namely through the <a href="https://griffin-erc-advanced-grant.eu/">Griffin</a> project.</li>
  <li>The report and presentation were done fully in Spanish.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Lowlights</h4>
<ul>
  <li>At the time, my knowledge was more limited regarding software tools like Docker. It slowed me down considerably due to having to work with tools like ROS and WeBots.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Lessons Learned</h4>

<h3>Palletizer Robotic Arm</h3>
<p>
  3D Printed Palletizer servo-controlled arm. Objective: pick up pieces and organize them by colour. Components: servo motors, colour sensor, lcd, ATmega328p.
</p>

<h4>Highlights</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Inspired interest in embedded systems</li>
  <li>Used different types of components</li>
  <li>Hardware restrictions led to creative solutions
    <ul>
      <li>The microcontroller only has 2 ports capable of running the servo motors, so separate transistors were used to make a "pin selector" to change how the pins were connected to each servo.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Lowlights</h4>
<ul>
  <li>It was during the COVID lockdown, so access to hardware tools was quite limited which made it harder to debug</li>
  <li>The component precision was low, so the whole project was a bit finnicky</li>
</ul>

<h4>Lessons Learned</h4>
<ul>
  <li>One must be careful with hardware, frying the chip is not difficult</li>
  <li>Necessity really leads to ingenuity</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bonus</h3>

<h4>Ray Tracer</h4>
<p>
  I followed this book to practice some C/C++ while learning something outside "my realm":
  <a href="https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html">Ray Tracing In One Weekend</a>. It takes you from nothing to creating an image like this (click the arrow to open the image):

</details>

<p>
  It is quite easy to follow and super satisfying to see some basic renders. The final result is very "bare bones", so a typo will leave you with something wrong like this:

<p>It only took like 1 hour to render, yey.</p>
