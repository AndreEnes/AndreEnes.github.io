### Ray Tracer

I followed this book to practice some C/C++ while learning something outside "my realm": [Ray Tracing In One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html). It takes you from nothing to creating an image like this:

![Final rendered image](/images/projects/craysiete/lindissimo.png)

It is quite easy to follow and super satisfying to see some basic renders. The final results is very "bare bones", so a typo will leave you with something wrong like this:

![Oopsie](/images/projects/craysiete/lindissirrissimo.png)

It only took like 1 hour to render, yey.
