## SiiuuuTunes

The name was inspired by the group name: **_C++R7_**. The best name and what one should be inspired to be.

This C++ project aimed to replicate core Spotify functionality, featuring multiple user roles: listener, artist, and admin. Users could sign up, create playlists, search songs, report artists, and explore promoted tracks.

Despite facing major challenges with MSYS2 library installations, GUI management, MP3 playback, and metadata extraction, the app implemented key features including:

- Role-based interface and permissions
- Dynamic playlists with song addition (handling SQL injection via input sanitization)
- A “SiiiUTunes” tab showcasing artist-promoted content
- Artist-specific menus for uploading songs
- Basic search and report mechanisms

Due to time constraints and limited documentation for audio libraries, MP3 playback was not fully implemented, though the team gained the necessary technical understanding and could have completed it with 1–2 more days.

### Tech Explored

- C++
- GTK
- Glade
- Postgres
- UML Diagrams
- OOP
- Audio Playback
- Databases

### Highlights

- The name is amazing.
- "Palpable" project with a GUI and a relatable objective.

### Lowlights

- I did not know about [WSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux). Developing C++ in Windows is one of the most if not the most frustrating experience of all time.
- Learning C++ while doing the project was interesting. I knew C before hand, so it was not as "shocking" as if I only knew Python.
- My OOP skills were in the "early stages".
- Had to basically do the project alone.

### Lessons Learned

- Sometimes is better to stick with the simpler solution.
- Be easy to work with is essential for everyone.
